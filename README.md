# Slot Machine Game

## DESCRIPTION
A simple slot machine game where everytime you press "Spin" 
you win or lose money based on the icons displayed, which are random.

## HOW TO PLAY
1. You start with $1000 and gamble 200 each time (I plan to add a betting system)
2. Press the "Spin!" button to spin the wheel
3. If you get three in a row ex: üê≤üê≤üê≤
4. If you dont get three in a row you lose 100$
5. Note that every five spins you will win $200 to stay in the game
6. You lose when you run out of money and have to press "Play Again?" restart
7. Have fun!
